## SettingValueType

Describes the data type of a setting value. Used in responses and setting entries.

```typescript
export enum SettingValueType {
  STRING  = 0,
  INTEGER = 1,
  FLOAT   = 2,
  BOOLEAN = 3,
  ENUM    = 4,
  RANGE   = 5,
}
```

| Value | Name | Description | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `0` | `STRING` | Free-form text | None |
| `1` | `INTEGER` | Whole number | `minValue`, `maxValue`, `stepValue` |
| `2` | `FLOAT` | Decimal number | `minValue`, `maxValue`, `stepValue` |
| `3` | `BOOLEAN` | True/false | None |
| `4` | `ENUM` | One of a set | `allowedValues` |
| `5` | `RANGE` | Numeric range | `minValue`, `maxValue`, `stepValue` |

<Tip>
  When returning settings of type `ENUM` or `RANGE`, include `ISettingConstraints` in the `ISettingEntry` to describe the valid values.
</Tip>

## UpdateResultStatus

Status codes returned after attempting to update a device setting.

```typescript
export enum UpdateResultStatus {
  SUCCESS           = 0,
  KEY_NOT_FOUND     = 1,
  INVALID_VALUE     = 2,
  PERMISSION_DENIED = 3,
  DEVICE_LOCKED     = 4,
  INTERNAL_FAILURE  = 5,
}
```

| Value | Name | When to use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `0` | `SUCCESS` | The setting was updated successfully |
| `1` | `KEY_NOT_FOUND` | The requested setting key does not exist |
| `2` | `INVALID_VALUE` | The provided value fails validation |
| `3` | `PERMISSION_DENIED` | The caller lacks permission to modify this setting |
